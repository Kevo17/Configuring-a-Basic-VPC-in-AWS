<h1>Configuring a Custom Domain with Cognito</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this hands-on lab scenario, youâ€™re a cloud network engineer tasked with setting up the security and network architecture for your organization's production environment. You'll have the opportunity to explore and understand the relationship between networking components. We will create a virtual private cloud (VPC), subnets across multiple availability zones (AZs), routes, and an internet gateway, as well as adding security using security groups and network access control lists (NACLs). These services are the foundation of networking architecture inside of AWS, and this lab will cover concepts such as infrastructure, design, routing, and security.
<br />

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 11</b>
- <b>AWS</b>

1. Navigate to EC2 and launc a new Instance.
2. On the Launch an instance page, in the name field, type hol-pub-instance.
3. In the Application and OS Images section, make sure, by default, that Amazon Linux 2 is selected for the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and make sure the Architecture is set to 64-bit (x86).
4. In the Instance Type section, select t3.micro from the dropdown.
5. In the Key pair (login) section, click Create new key pair.
6. In the Create key pair window, for the Key pair name, type vpcpubhol.
7 Leave the Key pair type set to RSA.
8. For the private key file format, choose either .pem or .ppk, depending on if you will use PuTTY or OpenSSH to connect to the EC2 instance later on.
- Note: Use .pem for a mac device; use .ppk for a Windows device.
9. Click Create key pair.
10. Back on the Launch an instance page, in the Network settings section, click Edit.
